# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a multilevel linear regression model to estimate medical insurance costs based on demographic and health-related data. It aims to assist healthcare insurers and individuals in understanding potential healthcare expenses.

## Methodologies Used
1. **Data Collection & Analysis** - Key variables like BMI, age, and region are analyzed to assess their impact on insurance costs.
2. **Data Pre-Processing** - Categorical features such as sex, smoker status, and region are encoded for machine learning compatibility.
3. **Model Training** - A multilevel linear regression model is employed to establish relationships between features and insurance costs.
4. **Model Evaluation** - The model's accuracy is tested through the R-squared value to ensure reliable predictions.

## Libraries and Frameworks Used
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy for numerical data handling.
- Scikit-learn for encoding categorical data and implementing linear regression.

## Key Findings
- Factors such as BMI, age, smoking status, and geographical region significantly influence insurance costs.
- The multilevel linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of 0.745, indicating a high level of accuracy given the methods used
